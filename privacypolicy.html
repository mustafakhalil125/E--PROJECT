    <li>Place an order; and</li>
    <li>Participate in our forums, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, content submissions, requests for suggestions, and membership registrations.</li>

 <p>
  <b>B. HOW WE USE "COOKIES" AND "ACTION TAGS."</b>
 </p>
 <p>
  A "cookie" is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer. We use cookies to let us know if you are a prior customer, user, or member and to provide certain features to you. Most web browsers allow you to instruct the browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the Services, such as the shopping basket, may not function properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our Service may also use a common web technology called "action tags" (also called single pixel gifs or web beacons) to track purchase, usage and other web activity information. Action tags may be used to provide data to third parties. In addition, third parties may set their own cookies and tags through our Service (such as through interest-based advertising, described below). We do not control such third parties or their privacy practices. If you do not want third parties to be able to use such methods, you should modify your browser settings to limit such access.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>C. INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING.</b>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>Our Services. We collect data from you for use in interest-based advertising when you use our Service. Other companies may serve interest-based advertisements on our Service. We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (aboutads.info). Interest-based advertisements for our products and services may appear on third party websites around the Internet. This is not based upon your personal information (such as your name or email address), but rather, upon your online activities.</li>
  <li>Opting Out. You may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies who are listed at https://www.aboutads.info/ or https://www.networkadvertising.org and you may also learn more about online behavioral advertising at such websites. After withdrawing your consent at any of the mentioned websites, you will still receive generic advertisements, but advertisements will not be delivered to you based upon the data possessed by those companies from whom you have opted-out. These opt-out processes rely upon an opt-out cookie for each browser and each device, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process. We do not respond to or honor "do not track" (a/k/a DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers</li>
